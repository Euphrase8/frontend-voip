# HTTP Microphone Access Guide

This guide explains how to enable microphone access for your VoIP application when running on HTTP instead of HTTPS.

## üö® Important Security Note

Modern browsers restrict microphone access on HTTP for security reasons. While the solutions below work for development and testing, **HTTPS is strongly recommended for production**.

## üåê Browser-Specific Solutions

### Google Chrome

#### Method 1: Command Line Flags (Recommended for Development)
```bash
# Windows
chrome.exe --unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure="http://172.20.10.4:3000" --user-data-dir="C:\temp\chrome-dev"

# macOS
/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure="http://172.20.10.4:3000" --user-data-dir="/tmp/chrome-dev"

# Linux
google-chrome --unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure="http://172.20.10.4:3000" --user-data-dir="/tmp/chrome-dev"
```

#### Method 2: Chrome Flags
1. Open `chrome://flags/` in Chrome
2. Search for "Insecure origins treated as secure"
3. Add your URL: `http://172.20.10.4:3000`
4. Restart Chrome

#### Method 3: Site Settings
1. Go to `chrome://settings/content/microphone`
2. Click "Add" next to "Allow"
3. Add your URL: `http://172.20.10.4:3000`

### Mozilla Firefox

#### Method 1: about:config (Recommended)
1. Open `about:config` in Firefox
2. Search for `media.devices.insecure.enabled`
3. Set it to `true`
4. Restart Firefox

#### Method 2: Site Permissions
1. Visit your site: `http://172.20.10.4:3000`
2. Click the lock icon in the address bar
3. Set Microphone to "Allow"

### Microsoft Edge

#### Method 1: Edge Flags
1. Open `edge://flags/` in Edge
2. Search for "Insecure origins treated as secure"
3. Add your URL: `http://172.20.10.4:3000`
4. Restart Edge

#### Method 2: Site Settings
1. Go to `edge://settings/content/microphone`
2. Click "Add" next to "Allow"
3. Add your URL: `http://172.20.10.4:3000`

### Safari

Safari has the strictest HTTPS requirements. For development:

1. Use Safari Technology Preview (more lenient)
2. Enable "Develop" menu in Safari preferences
3. Use "Disable Cross-Origin Restrictions" for testing

## üîß Application Configuration

The VoIP application now includes enhanced HTTP support:

### Features Added:
- ‚úÖ Automatic browser compatibility detection
- ‚úÖ Multiple getUserMedia fallback methods
- ‚úÖ Enhanced error messages with HTTP guidance
- ‚úÖ Visual compatibility alerts with quick fixes
- ‚úÖ Support for legacy browsers

### Browser Compatibility Alert
The app now shows a compatibility alert when running on HTTP with:
- Issues that prevent functionality
- Warnings about limited functionality
- Specific recommendations for your browser
- Quick action buttons for browser settings

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### For Local Development:
```bash
# Option 1: Use localhost (automatically trusted)
npm start -- --host localhost

# Option 2: Use 127.0.0.1 (automatically trusted)
npm start -- --host 127.0.0.1

# Option 3: Continue with IP but follow browser setup above
npm start
```

### For Network Access:
If you need to access from other devices on your network (like `172.20.10.4:3000`), follow the browser-specific solutions above.

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### "Microphone access denied"
1. Check browser permissions for the site
2. Ensure microphone is not being used by another app
3. Try the browser-specific solutions above

#### "getUserMedia is not supported"
1. Update your browser to the latest version
2. Check if you're using a supported browser
3. Try a different browser

#### "NotAllowedError" on HTTP
1. This is the main HTTP restriction
2. Follow the browser-specific solutions
3. Consider using HTTPS for production

### Testing Microphone Access:
```javascript
// Test in browser console
navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true })
  .then(stream => {
    console.log('‚úÖ Microphone access granted');
    stream.getTracks().forEach(track => track.stop());
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('‚ùå Microphone access failed:', error);
  });
```

## üöÄ Production Recommendations

### For Production Deployment:

1. **Use HTTPS**: Get an SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt is free)
2. **Reverse Proxy**: Use nginx/Apache with SSL termination
3. **CDN**: Use services like Cloudflare for automatic HTTPS
4. **Self-Signed Certificate**: For internal networks

### Quick HTTPS Setup with Self-Signed Certificate:
```bash
# Generate certificate
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes

# Use with your server
# (specific commands depend on your server setup)
```

## üì± Mobile Considerations

### iOS Safari:
- Requires HTTPS for microphone access
- No workarounds available
- Use HTTPS or test on desktop

### Android Chrome:
- Follows same rules as desktop Chrome
- Can use command line flags for testing
- HTTPS recommended for production

## üìû Support

If you continue to have issues:
1. Check the browser console for specific error messages
2. Verify your browser version supports WebRTC
3. Test with a different browser
4. Consider using HTTPS for the best experience

The VoIP application now provides detailed error messages and guidance when microphone access fails, making it easier to diagnose and resolve issues.
