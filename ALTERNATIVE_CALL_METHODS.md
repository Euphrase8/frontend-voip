# Alternative Call Initiation Methods

## Method 1: Pure WebRTC (Recommended for Quick Fix)

Instead of using Asterisk AMI to originate calls, use WebRTC directly between browsers with your backend as a signaling server.

### Advantages:
- No dependency on Asterisk endpoint registration
- Faster call setup
- Direct peer-to-peer audio
- Easier to debug and troubleshoot

### How it works:
1. Caller initiates call through frontend
2. Backend notifies target user via WebSocket
3. Both users establish WebRTC connection directly
4. Audio flows peer-to-peer (or through TURN server)

### Implementation:
- Keep Asterisk for SIP registration (optional)
- Use WebSocket for call signaling
- Use WebRTC for media exchange

## Method 2: SIP.js Direct Calling

Use SIP.js to make calls directly between registered endpoints without AMI origination.

### Advantages:
- Uses existing SIP infrastructure
- No AMI dependency for call initiation
- Standard SIP protocol

### How it works:
1. Both users register with Asterisk via WebSocket
2. Caller uses SIP.js to directly call target SIP URI
3. Asterisk handles call routing
4. No AMI origination needed

## Method 3: Hybrid Approach

Combine WebRTC signaling with SIP registration for best of both worlds.

### Advantages:
- Fast WebRTC setup
- SIP registration for presence
- Fallback options

## Method 4: Alternative PBX Solutions

Replace or supplement Asterisk with:
- FreeSWITCH
- Kamailio
- OpenSIPS
- Janus WebRTC Gateway

## Quick Implementation: Pure WebRTC

This is the fastest way to get calls working immediately.
